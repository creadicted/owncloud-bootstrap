owncloud-bootstrap
==================

This is an ownCloud theme that uses bootstrap as basis for the layout. 

INSTALLATION:
1. Copy the theme in to the themes folder.
2. Add:
      /* Theme to use for ownCloud */
      "theme" => "bootscloud",
  inside of the config.php file.

3. Add the content of the "util-extend.php" at the end of the lib/util.php file. 
4. clear the content of the core/css/styles.css file.
5. clear the content of the apps/files/css/files.css file


ABOUT THIS: 
I try to understand the architecture of ownCloud and I like bootstrap.  So I play around with the code. Feel free to join.
